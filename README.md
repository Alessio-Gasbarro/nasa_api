# nasa_api

In this project, I will create a Website that shows planets, stars, statistics, asteroids etcs.
And all that, using official's NASA Api!
My personal goal is to make a Website that not only works, but that is mainly based on a nice Design.

P.s.: This Project has nothing to do with Boolean Careers, means is a personal Project done in my free-time and is also not a group project.

Thanks for visiting this Repo!
